/** Keeps the list of Class Loaders registered in the MBean Server. It provides
 * the necessary methods to load classes using the registered Class Loaders.
 * 
 * This deprecated class is maintained for compatibility. In previous versions
 * of JMX, there was one DefaultLoaderRepository shared by all MBean servers.
 * As of JMX 1.2, that functionality is approximated by using
 * MBeanServerFactory.findMBeanServer(java.lang.String) to find all known MBean
 * servers, and consulting the ClassLoaderRepository of each one. It is
 * strongly recommended that code referencing DefaultLoaderRepository be
 * rewritten.
 * 
 * @deprecated Use MBeanServer.getClassLoaderRepository()} instead.
