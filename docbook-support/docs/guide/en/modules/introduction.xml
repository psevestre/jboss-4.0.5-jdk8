    <title>Introduction to DocBook proceessing</title>
    <para> DocBook is an XML format to write documents. It allows the author to
        focus on the content itself during the writing process instead of
        worrying about the presentation. </para>
    <para> Using the standard DocBook tags, we can tag the content according to
        their syntax structure. The DocBook document is then processed against
        XSL style sheets. Each tagged element in the DocBook is transformed to a
        presentation element with the style (e.g., margin, font etc.) specified
        in the XSL. Using different XSL stylesheets, we can generate different
        output documents. For example, we can generate HTML and PDF outputs from
        a single DocBook source. We can also generate multiple versions of PDF
        (or HTML) files each with a different formatting style. </para>
    <para> In the JBoss DocBook system, we provide XSL stylesheets to build HTML
        and PDF outputs from the DocBook source. The build process is
        illustrated in <xref linkend="build.fig"/>. </para>
