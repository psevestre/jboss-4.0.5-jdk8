      description="Yet another logging api. Patched to use a WeakHashMap
  such that it does not hold hard references to the classloaders.
  This also includes a mapping of the log.trace call to the custom
  org.jboss.logging.XLevel priority. Also includes an updated Log4JLogger that uses a Log4jProxy which allows for binding the log4j classes to the caller thread context class loader rather than the commons-logging class loader.">
