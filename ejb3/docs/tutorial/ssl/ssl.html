<h2> Invoking EJBs through SSL</h2>

</p><p>
If you build the tutorial, an ejb jar is created with ssl-service.xml and the local.keystore file.  The ssl-service.xml sets up a JAAS security manager to manage the SSL keystore.  This is documented pretty well in the JBoss 4.x manual.  ssl-service.xml also defines a JBoss Remoting connector.  The CalculatorBean EJB, uses the @RemoteBinding annotation to bind the SSL connector to the EJB.  The client has define the truststore used be the client.
