        <para> All JBoss documentation content developers and style developers
            should read this document. You should also read this if you want to
            build JBoss DocBooks from the public CVS tree. </para>

        <para> This document introduces the new unified DocBook system for JBoss
            documentation in the public CVS tree. There are a couple of reasons
            why we did this. </para>
        <itemizedlist>
            <listitem> It provides a unified set of styles to make sure that all
                JBoss DocBooks have a consistent look and feel. </listitem>
            <listitem> The styles can be managed from a central location. We can
                design new styles or fix bugs without worrying about
                "deployment" issues. </listitem>
            <listitem> The libraries and build scripts can also be managed from
                a central location. </listitem>
            <listitem> The build process is simplified and standardized. Just
                follow the simple instructions in this guide to setup your docs
                directory and copy a very simple <literal>build.xml</literal>
                file. </listitem>
            <listitem> Last but not least, we can reduce the duplication of
                style sheets, XSLs and libraries in the system. </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>
        
        <para> If you have questions, please feel free to contact Michael Yuan
            or Norman Richards for more information. </para>
